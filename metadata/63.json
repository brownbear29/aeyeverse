  "description": "With his almost shimmering speed, he arrived at the steps of where the Golem King stood and stopped, as he saw how the gigantic king was surrounded by clouds full of rain and lightning, with thunderous crackling, and a wind so strong it almost knocked the Prince off his feet.\\n\\nThe brave Prince raised his hands as though issuing a challenge, and let out the loudest shriek - a call, nearly a weapon, only known to Royals, the direct descendants of the King!\\n\\n[Season 1, Chapter 8 - The King of Golemia](https://eyeverse.world/chapter-8)",
