  "description": "With their faith restored, they continued ahead, this time venturing inside the deep caves the scavengers had come from. They were long and deep, and there were creatures roaming around that ran to hide as soon as they saw the formidable army marching inside. To their surprise, after a full day diving deeper and deeper into the caves, they found an underground kingdom.\\n\\nThis became their first conquest. Though the scavengers that lived there were weaker, there were many, and so the battle proved difficult, but soon enough they broke their population into submission and declared the underground as a new part of their mighty kingdom.\\n\\n[Season 1, Chapter 6 - Marching for War](https://eyeverse.world/chapter-6)",
