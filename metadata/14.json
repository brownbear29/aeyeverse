  "description": "The Queen of Red stood in an almost mesmerizing image of red traits, making her the fairest, most admired Queen of all the realms.

She was pushed and driven to breed and bring forth an army so grand in numbers to serve the Oppressor King.\\n\\n[Season 1, Bonus Chapter - The Queen of Red](https://eyeverse.world/the-queen-of-red)",
