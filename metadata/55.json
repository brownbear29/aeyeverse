  "description": "Soon enough, they were ready to embark on their quest. The weapons had been forged, the Watchers were stronger and the Royals had drawn maps of all the places they expected to take for themselves. It felt no different than opening a gate, even if there wasn't one in place. The members of the kingdom poured out of the bounds of the forest with great excitement, ready to discover, to fight, but most of all, to conquer this world that had just opened itself up to them.\\n\\n[Season 1, Chapter 5 - The King with the Masses](https://eyeverse.world/chapter-5)",
